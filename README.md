# Student Registration System

The Student Registration System is a simple shell script-based application designed to manage student records. It allows for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting student records, as well as extracting and sorting student emails. This application is intended for use in academic settings where managing a list of student details is required.

## Installation

To install the Student Registration System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository or download the source code**

   If using Git, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hirwablessing/coding-session-summative
   cd coding-session-summative
   ```

   Alternatively, download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

2. **Set execution permissions**

   Before running the application, you need to set execution permissions for the scripts:

   ```bash
   chmod +x main.sh select-emails.sh
   ```

## Installing required packages
The `rsync` and `sshpass` commands are not available on your system by default. You will need to install them first before running backup-Negpod_25.sh

```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt install rsync
```

```bash
sudo apt install sshpass
```

## Running the Application

To run the Student Registration System, execute the `main.sh` script from the terminal:

```bash
./main.sh
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations such as creating a student record, viewing all records, updating or deleting a record, and exiting the application.

To extract and sort student emails, run the `select-emails.sh` script:

```bash
./select-emails.sh
```

This will generate or update the `student-emails.txt` file with sorted email addresses from the student records.

You can choose any option from the app menu to play around with the app.
